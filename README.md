# LivingWages-WorkingPoor
Seeking data to determine the impact on the US economy and the bottom lines of corporations of every working adult receiving, at minimum, a "Living Wage".
Issues: 
  1. Defining "Living Wages" by area and over time
  2. Finding research and data on: <br>
    a. spending of individuals at each income level (and all income levels?)<br>
    b. change in spending when individuals move from living wages or more to working poor to non-working poor<br>
    c. determine the impact on US economy of all adult workers earning at least a living wage <br>
    d. determine decrease in government expenditures based on all adult workers earning at least a living wage<br>
    
    
  3. Determining the areas of living impacted by income and vice versa to account for them in the study to the extent applicable<br>
    a. Health - social determinants of health<br>
    b. Education - <br>
    c. Mobility - <br>
    d. Safety - <br>
    e. Interactions with law enforcement (peace officers?)<br>
    f. Dependence - <br>
    g. Resilience - <br>
